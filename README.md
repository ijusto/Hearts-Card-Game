# Hearts-Card-Game

## Rules
* Card rank (highest first):	**A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2**, no trump
* Play	Clockwise.
* The overall objective is to be the player with the fewest points by the end of the game.

## Dealing the cards
* 13 cards are dealt to each player (4 players)

## Passing cards
Before each hand begins, each player chooses three cards, and passes them to another player. It rotates passing through four deals; on the first deal, players pass to the left, the second deal to the right, the third across the table. On the fourth deal no cards are passed; the cycle of four deals is then repeated.

## Gameplay
* Players must follow suit;
* If they are not able to do so, they can play any card
* The player holding the **2 of clubs** must lead it to begin the first trick
* No penalty card may be played on the first trick (**hearts** or **Queen of spades**)
* **Hearts** cannot be led until they have been "broken" (discarded on the lead of another suit), unless the player who must lead has nothing but **Hearts** remaining in hand.

## Scoring
Each **Heart** taken in a trick scores one penalty point against the player winning the trick, and taking **Queen of spades** costs 13 penalty points. There are thus 26 penalty points in each deal. The game usually ends when one player reaches or exceeds 100 points. 
If one player takes all the penalty cards on one deal, that player's score remains unchanged while 26 penalty points are added to the scores of each of the other players. This is known as playing by "Old Moon" rules.
